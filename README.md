**Don't forget:**
Replace ```:author_name``` ```:author_username``` ```:package_name``` ```:package_description``` ```:github_organization``` with their correct values in [README.md](README.md), [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) and [package.json](package.json) files.

This is where your description should go. Try and limit it to a paragraph or two, and maybe throw in a mention of what
PSRs you support to avoid any confusion with users and contributors.
